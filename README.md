# Manta Garbage Collector

This repository is part of the Joyent Manta project.  For contribution
guidelines, issues, and general documentation, visit the main
[Manta](http://github.com/joyent/manta) project page.

This is the garbage collection system for Manta. It comprises a service for
processing metadata records pointing to deleted objects and ensuring that the
corresponding backing files are removed from the appropriate Mako zones.
