# Manta Garbage Collector

This repository is part of the Joyent Manta project.  For contribution
guidelines, issues, and general documentation, visit the main
[Manta](http://github.com/joyent/manta) project page.

## Active Branches

There are currently two active branches of this repository, for the two
active major versions of Manta. See the [mantav2 overview
document](https://github.com/joyent/manta/blob/master/docs/mantav2.md) for
details on major Manta versions.

- [`master`](../../tree/master/) - For development of mantav2, the latest
  version of Manta. This is the version used by Triton.
- [`mantav1`](../../tree/mantav1/) - For development of mantav1, the long
  term support maintenance version of Manta.

## Overview

This repo contains the bulk of the code for the Manta v2 garbage collector (GC)
system. The GC system is responsible for deleting files from the Manta storage
tier for objects that have been deleted in the metadata tier. At a high-level,
this system looks like:

![GCv2 Overview](img/GCv2-overview.png)

When a Directory-style object is deleted in Manta, the "metadata" for the object
is removed (from the `manta` table) and this removal causes a record to be
inserted into the `manta_fastdelete_queue` table via a database trigger. Each of
these `manta_fastdelete_queue` records includes:

 * a creator UUID
 * an owner UUID
 * an objectId
 * a set of "sharks" (storageIds) representing `storage` servers with a copy of the object's data
 * other metadata

It's the job of the `garbage-dir-consumer` in the `garbage-collector` zone to
pull records from Moray and write them to local "instructions" files. These
instructions files are then sent to the "mako" (storage zone) that holds the
actual files for the deleted objects. The `garbage-deleter` on the storage zone
reads these instructions and does the actual deletion before deleting each
instruction file.

When a buckets object is deleted in Manta the metadata is removed from the
buckets-mdapi and similar to the Directory-style a record is written that
indicates an object is read for garbage collection. With buckets-mdapi garbage
to be collected can be retrieved using the `getgcbatch` RPC. The garbage records
return include:

 * a bucket UUID
 * an owner UUID
 * an object UUID
 * the "name" of the object
 * a set of "sharks" (storageIds) representing `storage` servers with a copy of the object's data
 * other metadata

The `garbage-buckets-consumer` in the `garbage-collector` zone is responsible
for calling the getgcbatch function and turning the results into local
"instructions" files which are sent to the correct "mako" (storage zone) by the
`garbage-uploader` service. The `garbage-deleter` on the storage zone will then
see these instructions and process them just like it does for Directory-style
garbage deletion instructions.
